# Description
This project is a mix of Spring Boot and Angular. The idea is to have the benefits of the back and front end. Spring has a pretty useful security library, one of those is the encryption of data for users. This should be useful for having a CRM with Admin Privileges. On the other side Angular is the nowadays most-used front framework. The trouble here is mixing NodeJS and Java. But there is no complications because we got on both sides the RESTful concept and application.
